    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Line the bottom of a 18-23 cm (7-9 inch) springform cake pan with a circle
        of baking paper, then grease the paper and the sides of the pan.</li>
      <li>Melt the butter in a medium saucepan, then remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
      <li>Add the cocoa, sugar, flour, and vanilla to the butter and stir briefly. Then add the eggs and stir everything
        together until well combined.</li>
      <li>Pour the mixture into the cake pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes until the top is set but the center is still
        gooey (the top should be firm but crack slightly under light pressure from your finger).</li>
      <li>Let the cake cool in the pan, then run a knife between the pan and the cake to loosen it. Turn it out onto a
        plate or cake stand.</li>
      <li>Dust generously with cocoa powder and serve warm with ice cream or cream.</li>
    </ol>
